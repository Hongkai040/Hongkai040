Some projects I did include [puns detection task for GPT-3 models](https://github.com/Hongkai040/BIG-bench-35200-hongkai/tree/puns_json_task/bigbench/benchmark_tasks/puns_detection), [Negative Sentiment Shift on a Chinese Movie-rating Website](https://github.com/Hongkai040/Negative_Sentiment_Shift_in_Online_Community), [LLM sparsification experiments](https://github.com/Hongkai040/llm-sparsification-hongkai), large-scale parallel computing for gender disparity in movie comments, [Multi-modal analysis of gender disparity in movies](https://github.com/Hongkai040/Thinking_with_DL_Final), etc. Feel free to check out!

 

Sorry, I don’t have many repos now and many are private :( I will make some of them public soon!   Walk around on GitHub and come back later!
